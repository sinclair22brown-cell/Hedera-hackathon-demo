# Blockchain Certificate Verifier

## Problem
Certificate fraud is a growing issue across Africa. Many employers and schools waste time and resources verifying academic records, and fake certificates are common.

## Solution
A blockchain-powered certificate verification system built on the Hedera network. Schools can issue student certificates, which are stored as immutable records on Hedera. Employers can instantly verify the authenticity of certificates using a transaction ID or certificate hash.

## Features
- Schools issue certificates and store a hash on Hedera.
- Employers/stakeholders can verify authenticity online.
- Secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.
- Reduces fraud and builds trust in education systems.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Hedera Hashgraph
- **Frontend:** Simple web form for issuing & verifying certificates
- **Backend (future):** Node.js or Python integration with Hedera SDK

## Impact
- Helps students prove their credentials faster.
- Protects employers from hiring fraud.
- Saves schools time on manual verifications.
- Builds trust in Africaâ€™s education system.

## Next Steps
1. Build prototype UI for certificate issuance/verification.
2. Connect to Hedera testnet for certificate storage.
3. Deploy demo for judges to test.# Hedera-hackathon-demo
